<div style="text-align:center">

  <p>3. Create angular application which contains one button. When user press that
    button we have to display some text as “Educating for Better tomorrow” otherwise
    display “Marvellous Infosystems”.
    As we want to handle event of button click we have to use this tag as (click)= “fun()”. In this
    case inside the fun function we will change the text. </p>

  <button (click)="fun()">Button</button>
  <br>
  {{title}}
</div>
